	abstract = {The discrete event system specification formalism introduced by Zeigler in the 1970s is ideally associated with new technological advances in the web to offer an almost quasi-automatic mechanism for exporting its simulation models associated with experimental frames into web apps. In this paper, we show how, thanks to the association of certain current web concepts (cloud computing, application virtualization, etc.), discrete event system specification formalism makes it easier to develop web apps that use simulation models to assist decision-making. We propose a simulation model management system used by teams of data scientists, modelers, and developers (engineers) capable of building and deploying web applications from simulation models with minimal web development knowledge.},

	abstract = {Data is at the center of many challenges in system design today. Difficult issues need to be figured out, such as scalability, consistency, reliability, efficiency, and mainteinability. In addition, we have an overwhelming variet of tools, including relational databases, {NoSQL} datastores, stream or batch processors, and message brokers. What are the right choices for your application? How do you make sense of all these buzzwords? In this practical and comprehensive gjuide, author Martin Kleppmann helps you navigate this diverse landscape by examining the pros and cons of various technologies for processing and storing data. Software keeps changing, but the fundamental principles remain the same. With this book, software engineers and architects will learn how to apply those ideas in practice, and how to make full use of data in modern applications},
