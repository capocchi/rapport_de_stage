	abstract = {The discrete event system specification formalism introduced by Zeigler in the 1970s is ideally associated with new technological advances in the web to offer an almost quasi-automatic mechanism for exporting its simulation models associated with experimental frames into web apps. In this paper, we show how, thanks to the association of certain current web concepts (cloud computing, application virtualization, etc.), discrete event system specification formalism makes it easier to develop web apps that use simulation models to assist decision-making. We propose a simulation model management system used by teams of data scientists, modelers, and developers (engineers) capable of building and deploying web applications from simulation models with minimal web development knowledge.},
